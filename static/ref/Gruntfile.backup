RVM used your Gemfile for selecting Ruby, it is all fine - Heroku does that too,
you can ignore these warnings with 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore /Library/WebServer/Documents/findbball/Gemfile'.
To ignore the warning for all files run 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore allGemfiles'.

Upon termination of this License, you may continue to distribute the System-Provided Images as used within software you developed using the Developer Software; however, you agree to provide to Apple, at Apple's request, a copy of any software you developed using the Developer Software that incorporates any of the System-Provided Images so Apple may determine, in its sole discretion, whether your use of the System-Provided Images complies with these terms.

G. Location Services; Consents. 
1. Apple may enable you to access certain location-based application programming interfaces (APIs) (e.g., Core Location) documented by Apple (“Location APIs”) through the Developer Software.  Subject to these terms and conditions, you may use such APIs and services only to enable software programs you develop for use on OS X (“Applications”) to access location data (e.g. the real-time geographic location of a user’s computer) from users who consent to such access. For Applications that use Location APIs or otherwise provide location-based services, you agree that such Applications may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes. In addition, Applications that offer location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application. For Applications that use Location APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), you must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.

2. You agree that neither you nor your Applications will disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify the user that the user's location data is being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use.  If consent is denied or withdrawn, neither you nor your Applications may collect, transmit, maintain, process or utilize the user's location information or data through the Location APIs. You understand and agree that you and your Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations (including privacy, data collection and location service laws and regulations) in any jurisdictions in which your Applications may be delivered.  You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, related or attributable to, or otherwise involving your Application, including but not limited to your Application’s use of the Location APIs.

H. Xcode Server. If you access the Xcode Server feature of the Developer Software (e.g., via the command line tools), then you may use the Xcode Server feature for your own personal use or for internal use within your company or organization. You may not provide a service to third parties that integrates with or leverages services or information provided by Xcode Server or uses the Xcode Server feature in any way.  As a condition to using the Xcode Server feature of the Developer Software, you represent and warrant to Apple that you (and any user of a client-computer that you permit to access Xcode Server on your behalf) are appropriately licensed to use the applicable services, features or functionality of the Developer Software, the iOS SDK and/or the Apple Developer Program account accessed through the Xcode Server feature (e.g., you agree that anyone attempting to gain access to your Apple Developer certificates stored on Xcode Server must be a member of your Apple Developer Program team). You agree to monitor and will be responsible for all such use by any user of a client-computer that you permit to access Xcode Server and their compliance with the terms of this License and other applicable license agreements.

4.2     Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information
You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent. You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those of Your employees and contractors, or those of Your faculty and staff if You are an educational institution, who have a need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the Apple Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

4.3     Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential
Apple works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with Your Applications. Apple may also be developing its own similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that You may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about Your Application (such disclosures will be referred to as “Licensee Disclosures”). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. Apple will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You. You release Apple from all liability and obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee Disclosures. Any physical materials You submit to Apple will become Apple property and Apple will have no obligation to return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.

4.4     Press Releases and Other Publicity
You may not issue any press releases or make any other public statements regarding this Agreement, its terms and conditions, or the relationship of the parties without Apple’s express prior written approval, which may be withheld at Apple's discretion.

5.      Indemnification 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "Apple Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively "Losses") incurred by an Apple Indemnified Party as a result of Your breach of this Agreement, a breach of any certification, covenant, representation or warranty made by You in this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your use of the SDK, Your Application(s) or Your development of Applications.

You acknowledge that the SDK is not intended for use in the development of Applications in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services, data or information provided by the Application or the failure of the Application could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law, You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Apple Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such Apple Indemnified Party by reason of any such use.  In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects Apple's rights or binds Apple in any way, without the prior written consent of Apple.

6.      Term and Termination
6.1     Term  
The license to use this version of the SDK is effective until terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2     Termination
This Agreement and all rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple if You or any of Your Authorized Users fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. In addition, Apple reserves the right to terminate this Agreement if a new version of Apple’s iOS operating system software or the SDK is released which is incompatible with this version of the SDK.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience, for any reason or no reason, effective 30 days after providing the other party with written notice of its intent to terminate.

6.3     Effect of Termination
Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the SDK and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the SDK and all copies of Apple Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Users' possession or control. At Apple’s request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to Apple. The provisions of Sections 1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1(d), 3.2(c), 3.2(d), 3.2(e), 3.2(f), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will survive any termination of this Agreement. Apple will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Apple may have, now or in the future.  

7.      NO WARRANTY
The SDK may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and it may be incomplete. Apple may, through the SDK, provide or make available services (collectively the “Services”). Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE SDK AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. THE SDK AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK AND SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SDK, THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS IN THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH FUTURE APPLE PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WILL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SDK OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Location data provided by any Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Apple nor any of its licensors guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by any Services.

8.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR SERVICES, OR YOUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple’s total liability to You under this Agreement for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

9.      General Legal Terms
9.1     Third Party Notices 
Portions of the SDK utilize or include third party software and other copyrighted material. Acknowledgements, licensing terms and disclaimers for such material are contained in the electronic documentation for the SDK, and Your use of such material is governed by their respective terms.

9.2     Consent to Collection and Use of Non-Personal Data 
You agree that Apple and its subsidiaries may collect and use technical and related information, including but not limited to information about Your Applications, computer, system software, other software and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates and other services to You (if any) related to the SDK, and to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Apple may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve the SDK, our products or to provide services or technologies to You and our customers.  

9.3     Assignment
This Agreement may not be assigned, nor may any of Your obligations under this Agreement be delegated, in whole or in part, by You by operation of law, merger, or any other means without Apple’s express prior written consent and any attempted assignment without such consent will be null and void.

9.4     Relationship of Parties  
This Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other form of legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. This Agreement is not for the benefit of any third parties.

9.5     Independent Development 
Nothing in this Agreement will impair Apple's right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Your Applications or any other products or technologies that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

9.6     Notices
Any notices relating to this Agreement shall be in writing. Notices will be deemed given by Apple when sent to You at the email address You provided as part of Your Registered Apple Developer sign-up process. Notices to Apple will be deemed given (a) when delivered personally, (b) three business days after having been sent by commercial overnight carrier with written proof of delivery, and (c) five business days after having been sent by first class or certified mail, postage prepaid, to this Apple address:  iOS SDK Licensing, Apple Inc., 12545 Riata Vista Circle, MS 198-3SWL, Austin, TX 78727, USA. You consent to receive notices by email and agree that any such notices that Apple sends You electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements. A party may change its email or mailing address by giving the other written notice as described above. 

9.7     Severability 
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any clause of this Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that clause of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. However, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and specifically complying with the Sections of this Agreement entitled "SDK Internal Use License and Restrictions" or "Your Obligations" or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this Agreement will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the SDK as described in the Section entitled “Term and Termination.”

9.8     Waiver and Construction  
Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any laws or regulations that provide that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement. Section headings are for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.

9.9     Export Control 
You may not use, export, re-export, import, sell or transfer the SDK except as authorized by United States law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which You obtained the SDK, and any other applicable laws and regulations. In particular, but without limitation, the SDK may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the SDK, You represent and warrant that You are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that You will not use the SDK for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  

9.10    Government End Users 
The SDK and Documentation are “Commercial Items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.

9.11    Dispute Resolution; Governing Law 
Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the SDK, or Your relationship with Apple will take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the state and federal courts within that District with respect any such litigation or dispute resolution. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if You are an agency, instrumentality or department of the federal government of the United States, then this Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, and in the absence of applicable federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply. Further, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including but not limited to Section 5 (Indemnification)), all claims, demands, complaints and disputes will be subject to the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. §§601-613), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1346(a) and § 1491), or the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2401-2402, 2671-2672, 2674-2680), as applicable, or other applicable governing authority.  

If You (as an entity entering into this Agreement) are a U.S. public and accredited educational institution, then (a) this Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state (within the U.S.) in which Your educational institution is domiciled, except that body of state law concerning conflicts of law; and (b) any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the SDK, or Your relationship with Apple will take place in federal court within the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue of such District unless such consent is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state in which Your educational institution is domiciled.  

This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

9.12    Entire Agreement; Governing Language
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the SDK licensed hereunder and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified only: (a) by a written amendment signed by both parties, or (b) to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement (for example, by Apple by written or email notice to You). Any translation of this Agreement is done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English version, the English version of this Agreement shall govern.
