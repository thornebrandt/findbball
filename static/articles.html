                            <h2>What You Don't Know May Kill You</h2>
                            <p>Cyrus told Rolling Stone in June that she was singing “dancing with Miley,” which people misinterpeted because of her country accent. But last month she told the same magazine, “Hollywood is a (cocaine) town, but weed is so much better. And molly too. Those are happy drugs—social drugs. They make you want to be with friends.”</p>

                            <p>Although the DPA reports that overdoses are rare, deaths have been connected to the drug in recent months.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the summer, officials pulled the plug on the third day of New York’s Electric Zoo after two festivalgoers died from MDMA overdoses, the city’s medical examiner confirmed.</p>

                            <p>Breaking molly’s ties to the music industry might be tough, but Sharples said she has hope.</p>

                            <p>“Unfortunately, the correlation between drugs and dance music is as old as the genre itself, but now that the genre has more of a widespread interest across the world, the drug scene that lurks behind it is getting a lot more attention and more (business),” she said.</p>

                            <p>“It doesn’t have to be that way though,” she continued. “But it’s going to take a lot of people to change that within the community, including festival organizers and performers.”</p>

                            <h2>5 Foul Smells That Are Affecting Your Game</h2>
                            <p>It may be possible to "sniff out" sickness, according to a new study.</p>

                            <p>The research, published in the journal Psychological Science, shows that it's possible to detect differences in odor that occur from a body's increased immune response.</p>

                            <p>For the study, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden had eight healthy people receive injections of either a saline solution (the control group), or injections of a toxin that is known to increase the body's immune response (it caused the participants to have a higher body temperature, and also increased the immune response by upping levels of cytokines). The researchers had the participants wear tight shirts to absorb their sweat for four hours.</p>

                            <p>Then, 40 separate study participants were asked to sniff the sweaty shirts of the people who received the toxin or saline injections. They were asked to describe any differences in smell.</p>

                            <p>The shirts that were worn by the people injected with the toxin were described as having an "unhealthier," more unpleasant, and more intense smell, than the shirts worn by the people injected with the saline.</p>

                            <p>When researchers looked at the actual number of odorous compounds in the sweaty shirts of the toxin-injected people and the saline-injected people, they found no differences, which suggests that the differences in odor may instead be from the composition of the compounds, versus the number of compounds.</p>

                            <p>The findings suggest "there may be early, possibly generic, biomarkers for illness in the form of volatile substances coming from the body,” study researcher Mats Olsson said in a statement.</p>

                            <h2>Mysterious Shadow Eats Handicapped Child</h2>
                            <p>A gray sheet of clouds stretched across the sky as 12-year-old Doug ran to the corner store. “It was overcast but not raining, and in the middle of the afternoon,” Doug said. The day was shadowless, and decades later he still doesn’t know what he saw on his way home from the store, arms laden with food. At first, he thought it was a friend. “As I approached the corner to turn onto my street, I saw something black sticking beyond the bushes in the front of my house,” Doug said. “I yelled, ‘Andre,’ and started running toward my driveway where the bushes are.”</p>
                            <p>The dark figure wasn’t his friend Andre. A black, man-shaped Shadow grew from behind the bushes in this quiet afternoon and began running toward Doug’s house. “After a few steps I saw the Shadow running down my driveway toward the back yard,” he said. “I ran up the driveway to the gate that leads to my back yard. I couldn’t believe my eyes.”</p>
                            <p>Doug stood at the gate as the black Shadow in the shape of a man ran across his yard and disappeared through a fence. “I was shocked,” he said. “I couldn’t stop thinking about it. This thing; what could it be? Why was it black when most stereotypical stories said that ghosts were white? Could this be demonic? Could it be like me, just a person? Then it ate a handicapped child. That was crossing the line.</p>
